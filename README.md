# Image-Processing-Project

###  Even after your best efforts you couldn't get the best Quality Image!! and your wishing to have a System to be smart enough to detect Noisy Image and implement the best Noise Removal Algorithm to give the User High Quality Images. What if I say that it's Possible. That's our Project!!

### Objective
The Main Objective of the Project is to help the user to judge the best Noise Removal Algorithm for a particular image accessed over an Graphical UI that makes it is easy to use and gives results as needed.

### Languages
Developed with languages and frameworks of **C, GTK and OpenGL** and works with *16bit bitmap image format* when passed to the system gives the result across 6 different Noise Removal Algorithms implemented in the system that provides statistical Graphic result over commonly found Salt & Pepper and Guassian Noise Models.

### How to access the System
* Use any IDE like CodeBlocks and integrate C language in it
* Integrate [GTK Platform](#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E9JsX2tS7g) to the System
* As well as Integrate [OpenGL Platform](#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPcnymtP2SE) to the CodeBlocks IDE Environment
* Then implement the main file in the system and run the code

### Advantages of Using the System
Ever wonder why the images you capture on your Phone or DSLR's get Noisy Images even when you used tripod or used other safety precautions. It's not your fault but it might be the defect or aging of Semi-Conductor material or disturbances in the Environment that creates such images. Thus Noise Removal Algorithms could come in handy.
So in that scenario, there isn't any particular Algorithm that could be implemented in any Noisy Case. So our System would automatically detect which Algorithm gives the best result and applies that Algorithm on the Image thus producing better Quality Images on the Go.

## Important Note
Also the user would include the Git link used and Contributor's name in their work.
